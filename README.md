# `go-beautiful-html-coverage`

A GitHub Action to track code coverage in your pull requests, with a beautiful HTML preview, for free.

## Usage

To use this action simply add it to your pre-existent ci workflow. A bare minimal example might look like this:

```yaml
name: Go

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  test:
    name: Build and Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write        # required for posting comments
      contents: write             # required for git push
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v5

      - name: Test                # this should generate cover.out
        run: make test

      - name: Go Beautiful HTML Coverage
        uses: 'gha-common/go-beautiful-html-coverage@v1'
```

## How it works

This GHA expects `cover.out` to be present in the root of your repo at runtime. `cover.out` is usually generated by `go test` when passing the `-coverprofile=cover.out` flag:

```sh
go test -coverprofile=cover.out ./...
```

For examples on how you might do that you can peak at the [`Makefile`](./Makefile), or some of my other go projects like [`pretender`](https://github.com/kilianc/pretender/blob/main/Makefile#L44-L57) and [`base-go-cli`](https://github.com/kilianc/base-golang-cli/blob/main/Makefile#L76-L92).

Once your test has ran and `cover.out` has been generated, the GHA does the following:

1. Create and push [new orphan branch](https://github.com/gha-common/go-beautiful-html-coverage/tree/cover) if one doesn't exist.
1. Generate `cover.html` and `cover.txt` from `cover.out`.
1. Customize `cover.html` and rename it `<sha>.html`.
1. `git-push` the `<sha>.html` file to the orphan branch. This will trigger a `GitHub Pages` deployment.
1. Post a comment to your PR with your code coverage summary (`cover.txt`) and a link to your `<sha>.html`.

> In order for the HTML preview links to work, configure `GitHub Pages` in your target repo *(`Settings > Pages`)* to `Deploy from a branch` and pick your target branch, which is, by default, `cover`.

## Reference

```yaml
- name: Go Beautiful HTML Coverage
  uses: 'gha-common/go-beautiful-html-coverage@v1'
  with:
    # Repository name with owner. For example, actions/checkout.
    # Default: ${{ github.repository }}
    repository: ''

    # The branch to checkout or create and push coverage to.
    # Default: 'cover'
    branch: ''

    # The token to use for pushing to the repository.
    # Default: ${{ github.token }}
    token: ''
```

## Examples

**You can customize the name of the branch that hosts the code coverage files.**

```yaml
- name: Go Beautiful HTML Coverage
  uses: 'gha-common/go-beautiful-html-coverage@v1'
  with:
    branch: 'my-coverage'
```

Just make sure to update the `GitHub Pages` deployment settings to match.

**You can customize the repository that hosts the code coverage files.**

This is helpful if you don't want to clutter your project's repo, or if you want to centralize coverage reporting across multiple repos, or you can't turn on `GitHub Pages` in your project's repo.

```yaml
- name: Go Beautiful HTML Coverage
  uses: 'gha-common/go-beautiful-html-coverage@v1'
  with:
    repository: yourname/coverage
    token: ${{ secrets.GHA_COVERAGE_TOKEN }}
```

Where `GHA_COVERAGE_TOKEN` is a repository secret with a personal token that has write access to `yourname/coverage`.
